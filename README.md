• Added a fun fact about me that is revealed when the user clicks on a button. I now understand how to use JavaScript to add interactivity to a website. Added a hover effect to my picture, which makes it brighter when the user hovers over it using CSS.

• Integrated the Dog CEO API, which returns a random dog image every time it is called. I learned how to fetch data from an external API using JavaScript’s fetch() function and update an image dynamically. The async/await syntax made it easy to handle asynchronous requests, and I also added a button to fetch a new dog image on demand. I now understand how dynamic content can be loaded into a website.

• Added interactivity using the mousemove and mouseleave events on the dog image. When a user moves their mouse over the dog, the image slightly enlarges, a message appears thanking the user for petting the dog. I learned how mousemove can detect when the user interacts with an element dynamically, which is something that can't be done with just CSS pseudo-classes like :hover. 

• Explored Open Graph meta tags to enable rich previews when my website is shared on social media. I learned that og:title, og:description, and og:image are crucial for making links visually appealing on platforms like Facebook, Discord, and WhatsApp. This makes my site look more professional and engaging when shared.

• I used GoatCounter for tracking the number of visitors to my website.

• Advantages: GoatCounter is a privacy-friendly, open-source analytics tool that doesn’t use cookies or track users across websites, making it lightweight and GDPR-compliant. It’s easy to set up and ideal for personal projects that don’t require advanced tracking features.

• Disadvantages: Compared to Google Analytics, it provides only basic insights and lacks deep behavioral tracking, which may not be sufficient for businesses. Additionally, its free plan is limited to non-commercial use, and fewer developers are familiar with its interface.
